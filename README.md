# What Should I Cook For Dinner?

A simple tool to help decide what to cook for dinner because no-one can ever decide.

## Scripts
- `rename.sh` - Renames recipe files (PDF/JPG) to sequential numbers for consistent organisation and so the script loads the files.

## Usage
Drop your recipe files into the designated folder and run the rename script to organise them.

## Legal Notice
Please note: The recipe files (PDF/JPG) included are downloaded from my personal account for personal use only. All rights belong to their respective owners.
I haven't included them in the repo but if you know, then you know, if you know what I mean.
